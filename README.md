# Odin-Landing-Page

I created this page to mirror the example given for the assignment.  I added some free use photos from Unsplash, but kept all text the same. I used a lot of flexbox, but instead of using it to align all the items together (as shown in the example TOP gave) I decided to open up the space more as it seemed to look better.
